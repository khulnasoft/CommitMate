   A CLI that converts natural language to shell commands.

# AI Shell

## Setup

> The minimum supported version of Node.js is v14

1. Install _ai shell_:

   ```sh
   npm install -g @khulnasoft/commitmate
   ```

2. Retrieve your API key from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)

   > Note: If you haven't already, you'll have to create an account and set up billing.

3. Set the key so commitmate can use it:

   ```sh
   ai config set OPENAI_KEY=<your token>
   ```

   This will create a `.commitmate` file in your home directory.

## Usage

```bash
ai <prompt>
```

For example:

```bash
ai list all log files
```

Then you will get an output like this, where you can choose to run the suggested command, revise the command via a prompt, or cancel:

```bash
‚óá  Your script:
‚îÇ
‚îÇ  find . -name "*.log"
‚îÇ
‚óá  Explanation:
‚îÇ
‚îÇ  1. Searches for all files with the extension ".log" in the current directory and any subdirectories.
‚îÇ
‚óÜ  Run this script?
‚îÇ  ‚óè ‚úÖ Yes (Lets go!)
‚îÇ  ‚óã üìù Revise
‚îÇ  ‚óã ‚ùå Cancel
‚îî
```

### Special characters

Note that some shells handle certain characters like the `?` or `*` or things that look like file paths specially. If you are getting strange behaviors, you can wrap the prompt in quotes to avoid issues, like below:

```bash
ai 'what is my ip address'
```

### Chat mode

```bash
ai chat
```

With this mode, you can engage in a conversation with the AI and receive helpful responses in a natural, conversational manner directly through the CLI:

```sh
‚îå  Starting new conversation
‚îÇ
‚óá  You:
‚îÇ  how do I serve a redirect in express
‚îÇ
‚óá  AI Shell:

In Express, you can use the `redirect()` method to serve a redirect. The `redirect()` method takes one argument, which is the URL that you want to redirect to.

Here's an example:

\`\`\`js
app.get('/oldurl', (req, res) => {
  res.redirect('/newurl');
});
\`\`\`
```

### Silent mode (skip explanations)

You can disable and skip the explanation section by using the flag `-s` or `--silent`

```bash
ai -s list all log files
```

or save the option as a preference using this command:

```bash
ai config set SILENT_MODE=true
```

### Custom API endpoint

You can custom OpenAI API endpoint to set OPENAI_API_ENDPOINTÔºàdefault: `https://api.openai.com/v1`Ôºâ

```sh
ai config set OPENAI_API_ENDPOINT=<your proxy endpoint>
```

### Set Language

The AI Shell's default language is English, but you can easily switch to your preferred language by using the corresponding language keys, as shown below:

| Language            | Key     |
| ------------------- | ------- |
| English             | en      |
| Simplified Chinese  | zh-Hans |
| Traditional Chinese | zh-Hant |
| Spanish             | es      |
| Japanese            | jp      |
| Korean              | ko      |
| French              | fr      |
| German              | de      |
| Russian             | ru      |
| Ukrainian           | uk      |
| Vietnamese          | vi      |
| Arabic              | ar      |
| Portuguese          | pt      |
| Turkish             | tr      |

For instance, if you want to switch to Simplified Chinese, you can do so by setting the LANGUAGE value to zh-Hans:

```sh
ai config set LANGUAGE=zh-Hans
```

This will set your language to Simplified Chinese.

### Config UI

To use a more visual interface to view and set config options you can type:

```bash
ai config
```

To get an interactive UI like below:

```bash
‚óÜ  Set config:
‚îÇ  ‚óã OpenAI Key
‚îÇ  ‚óã OpenAI API Endpoint
‚îÇ  ‚óã Silent Mode
‚îÇ  ‚óè Model (gpt-4o-mini)
‚îÇ  ‚óã Language
‚îÇ  ‚óã Cancel
‚îî
```

### Upgrading

Check the installed version with:

```bash
ai --version
```

If it's not the [latest version](https://github.com/khulnasoft/commitmate/tags), run:

```bash
npm update -g @khulnasoft/commitmate
```

Or just use AI shell:

```bash
ai update
```

## Common Issues

### 429 error

Some users are reporting a 429 from OpenAI. This is due to incorrect billing setup or excessive quota usage. Please follow [this guide](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6891831-error-code-429-you-exceeded-your-current-quota-please-check-your-plan-and-billing-details) to fix it.

You can activate billing at [this link](https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/overview). Make sure to add a payment method if not under an active grant from OpenAI.

## Motivation

I am not a bash wizard, and am dying for access to the copilot CLI, and got impatient.
